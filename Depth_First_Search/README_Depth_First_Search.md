/* A Java program that performs a depth first search on a specific graph given The traversal is implemented iteratively by using an explicit stack which is called in the main function. The class representing the directed graph using adjacency lists are given which gives the number of verticies, creates the integer linked list, constructor, and each of the edges in the graph, g. The depth first search starts from the node and travels across branches until the end is reach and backtracks. The time complexity followed is O(V+E) and space complexity is O(V) where v stands for vertices and e stands for edges, respectively. since this algorithm utilizes graphs, cycles may exist. In order to avoid the nodes more than once, a boolean visited array was created. The resulting print statement in the main function is the call to the depth first search method created previously.
